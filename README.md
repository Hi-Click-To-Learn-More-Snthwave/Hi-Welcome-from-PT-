# Hi-Welcome-from-PT-
Let's learn more about me, yeah? I'm happy to introduce myself!

You are most likely seeing this because you got curious as to who I am on pt!

I am 25, a dude and really laid back and chill. I'm 420 friendly and it takes a lot to offend me

You can typically find me chilling or taking part in rps, I'm always happy to rp or chat and you are always welcome to sit with me, vent to me or cuddle me!

I'm very friendly pretty much all the time so don't be afraid to say hello and chill I don't bite... Most of the time >:3

I love music, and of course video games and I may or may not love me my coffee and energy drinks

Ask me about my cos and ocs to watch me geek out hardcore

!!!SOMETHINGS TO NOTE!!!

Its very rare I ERP so please don't ask

NO MINORS PLEASE! For obvious reasons I don't want my friends list to contain minors

I may be single but your chances of ODing me is so small you'd have a better shot at winning the lottery

No drama

I'm always happy to make friends but I will remove you for a number of reasons including lying about your age, constant drama, attention seeking or being inactive for 14 or more days

Be paient with me, I can become easily distracted and I'm very slow socially so I wont pick up on social Qs all that well

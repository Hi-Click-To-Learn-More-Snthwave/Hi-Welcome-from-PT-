# Hi-Welcome-from-PT-
Let's learn more about me, yeah? I'm happy to introduce myself!

You are most likely seeing this because you got curious as to who I am on pt!

I'm 25, a dude and really laid back and chill. I'm 420 friendly and it takes a lot to offend me

Happily taken by the love of my life Rosi <3 (6/17/24)

I'm Pansexual/Greyromantic

I'm a selective mute

You can typically find me chilling or taking part in rps, I'm always happy to rp or chat and you are always welcome to sit with me, vent or chill

I'm very friendly pretty much all the time so don't be afraid to say hello and chill

I love music, and of course video games and I may or may not love me my coffee and energy drinks

Ask me about my cos and ocs to watch me geek out hardcore

!!!SOMETHINGS TO NOTE!!!

I'm taken so don't even try to ask for erp, fast way to get hidden

NO MINORS PLEASE! For obvious reasons I don't want my friends list to contain minors

No drama

I'm always happy to make friends but I will remove you for a number of reasons including lying about your age, constant drama, attention seeking or being inactive for 14 or more days

Be paient with me, I can become easily distracted and I'm very slow socially so I wont pick up on social Qs

We love BPD1 here (not really, send help)

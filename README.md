I# Hi-Welcome-from-PT-
Let's learn more about me, yeah? I'm happy to introduce myself!

TLDR Ver: 26 male, minors DNI, borderline personality disorder, C+H allowed, willing to rp, stoner, feel free to chat, I rarely Online date if at all, not worth the hassle. I rarely ERP if at all. You can do MVs of my OCs freely but ask before matching or copying as some are no. Trying to take credit for my OCs will result in a perma block.



FULL Ver: You are most likely seeing this because you got curious as to who I am on pt!

I'm 26, a dude and really laid back and chill. I'm 420 friendly and it takes a lot to offend me

I'm just a drifter. Love isn't worth my time man because people are cruel and unforgiving

I'm Pansexual/Greyromantic

I'm a selective mute

You can typically find me chilling in the library or taking part in rps, I'm always happy to rp or chat and you are always welcome to sit with me, vent or chill

I'm very friendly pretty much all the time so don't be afraid to say hello and chill

I love music, and of course video games and I may or may not love me my coffee and energy drinks

Ask me about my cos and ocs to watch me geek out hardcore

!!!SOMETHINGS TO NOTE!!!

You can take inspiration from my ocs, I'm not stuk up like others though I do ask you ask me before doing an MV, matching or a copy of any of my OCS as some are a no. If you get permission and try to take credit you will be perma blocked as It's not cool bro

I'm more likely to ERP if I know you but even than its rare if at all

I rarely ever Online Date since its more or a hassle and nothing good has ever come from it

NO MINORS PLEASE! For obvious reasons I don't want my friends list to contain minors

No drama

I'm always happy to make friends but I will remove you for a number of reasons including lying about your age, constant drama, attention seeking or being inactive for 30 or more days

Be paient with me, I can become easily distracted and I'm very slow socially so I wont pick up on social Qs as well as I have Borderline Personality Disorder so please be patient
